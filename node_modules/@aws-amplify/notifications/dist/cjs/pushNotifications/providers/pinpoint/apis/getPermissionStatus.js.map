The possible\n * statuses are as follows:\n *\n *   * `'shouldRequest'` - No permissions have been requested yet. It is idiomatic at this time to simply request for\n *   permissions from the user.\n *\n *   * `'shouldExplainThenRequest'` - It is recommended at this time to provide some context or rationale to the user\n *   explaining why you want to send them push notifications before requesting for permissions.\n *\n *   * `'granted'` - Permissions have been granted by the user. No further actions are needed and their app is ready to\n *   display notifications.\n *\n *   * `'denied'` - Permissions have been denied by the user. Further attempts to request permissions will no longer\n *   trigger a permission dialog. Your app should now either degrade gracefully or prompt your user to grant the\n *   permissions needed in their device settings.\n *\n * @throws platform: {@link PlatformNotSupportedError} - Thrown if called against an unsupported platform. Currently,\n * only React Native is supported by this API.\n * @return {Promise<GetPermissionStatusOutput>} a promise resolving to a string representing the current status of user\n * selected notification permissions.\n * @example\n * ```ts\n * const permissionStatus = await getPermissionStatus();\n */\nconst getPermissionStatus = async () => {\n    throw new utils_1.PlatformNotSupportedError();\n};\nexports.getPermissionStatus = getPermissionStatus;\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;AACA;AACA;AACA,MAAM,CAAC,cAAc,CAAC,OAAO,EAAE,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC;AAC9D,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,GAAG,KAAK,CAAC,CAAC;AACrC,MAAM,OAAO,GAAG,OAAO,CAAC,mCAAmC,CAAC,CAAC;AAC7D;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,MAAM,mBAAmB,GAAG,YAAY;AACxC,IAAI,MAAM,IAAI,OAAO,CAAC,yBAAyB,EAAE,CAAC;AAClD,CAAC,CAAC;AACF,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,GAAG,mBAAmB;;"}
