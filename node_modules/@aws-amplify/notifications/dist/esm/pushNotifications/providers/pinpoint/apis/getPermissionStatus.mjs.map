It is idiomatic at this time to simply request for\n *   permissions from the user.\n *\n *   * `'shouldExplainThenRequest'` - It is recommended at this time to provide some context or rationale to the user\n *   explaining why you want to send them push notifications before requesting for permissions.\n *\n *   * `'granted'` - Permissions have been granted by the user. No further actions are needed and their app is ready to\n *   display notifications.\n *\n *   * `'denied'` - Permissions have been denied by the user. Further attempts to request permissions will no longer\n *   trigger a permission dialog. Your app should now either degrade gracefully or prompt your user to grant the\n *   permissions needed in their device settings.\n *\n * @throws platform: {@link PlatformNotSupportedError} - Thrown if called against an unsupported platform.
