          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Saayam For All is a volunteer-based organization that helps connect
            people in need with compassionate local volunteers. We operate
            through a cloud-native application that supports requests for
            essentials such as food, housing, education, healthcare, clothing,
            and general guidance. This platform is driven by values of service,
            inclusion, and humanity, and is free of religious, political, or
            commercial bias. By using Saayam For All, you accept and agree to
            abide by these Terms in full.

          <h2>1. Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Saayam For All is a humanitarian platform rooted in compassion,
            built entirely by volunteers and experts who believe in service to
            others. Our mission is to bridge the gap between people in need and
            those who are willing to help. The platform is inspired by the
            principles of selfless service, inclusivity, and technological
            empowerment. We aim to be a global hub where anyone can request
            essential assistance, and volunteers can offer their support without
            the expectation of compensation.
